On this site you will find statistics on the performance of the Brazilian national team at the World Championships, a brief historical excursion and review articles on the famous periods of participation of the Brazilian national team at the World Championships where in each post there will be an article, as well as a video review and under these posts each participant will be able to leave a comment and share impressions and memories.

FootBrazil - was developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python (Django).

## User Experience

### Project goal

The purpose of the site is to provide, with the help of web development, visitors the opportunity to easily immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the Brazilian national team and its participation in the World Cup.

### User Stories


### Agile methodology

This project was developed using the agile methodology. Necessary goals and priorities were well defined throughout the project. In addition, labels were used to define the priority of each user story.

Visitors can read posts and view video but not to add a comment under this. Registred users can add a comment under posts. Administrator of site can adding, updating & deleting comments.

### Design

- The design of the website should be combined with the theme, and since the theme of the site is the Brazilian national football team, the design of the website is focused on the combination of the colors of the Brazilian national team.

#### Colours

- The color scheme predominantly consists of a variety of greys, greens, whites and blues. The use of gray and dark white creates a background tone, while the green is refreshing and correlates with one of the colors of the Brazilian flag, which matches the theme of the website. The blue color brightens up dark colors and, like green, is part of the Brazilian flag. The black color clearly indicates the bottom panel of the site.

#### Fonts

-  In order for the site to blend beautifully with the text, two text styles were used:

"Jersey 10" - was used for the main page as a welcome message, which goes well with the main image of the site.

"Exo" - was used as the main style of page texts.

"Crimson Text" - this style took just in case, but I didnâ€™t use it
