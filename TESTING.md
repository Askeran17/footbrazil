## Testing

Throughout the development of the site, I used Google's developer tools to identify and fix any problems along the way.

If something didn't work correctly, I also used Google's developer tools to tweak and fix the problem.

I've thoroughly tested each page using Google Chrome's developer tools to ensure each page is responsive on a variety of screen sizes and devices.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Desktop Results

The site showed good scores.
