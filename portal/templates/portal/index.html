    <p class="front-page-text">The Brazilian national football team is the only team that has not missed a single final
        stage of the World Cup. The Brazilians were the first to win titles on three different continents and in three
        different parts of the world (America, Europe and Asia; North America, South America and Eurasia). The team also
        won the Confederations Cup four times, a record. In addition, the Brazilians have 9 victories in the America's
        Cup, the most prestigious team tournament on the continent. According to this indicator, on the continent they
        are second only to Uruguay and Argentina. The Brazilian national team is the only one who has won the world
        championship five times. In addition, the Seleçao have two sets of silver medals, two bronze medals and one for
        fourth place in 1974. Since 2002, after their fifth victory at the World Championships, they are called
        “Pentakampeons” (port. Pentacampeões) - five-time champions. On our website you will find statistics on the
        performances of the Brazilian national team at the World Cup and a brief overview of these participations, and
        most importantly, you will plunge into the history of the best selected performances of the team at the World
        Cup, namely 1970, 1982, 1994, 2002, and also compare with the performances recent years at the 2014 and 2022
        championships.</p>
